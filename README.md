In this project, we will analyze a data set about online browsing behavior, and identify significant association rules among the items. Each line represents a browsing session of a customer, and each item is represented by a string of 8 characters.

We will implement the A Priori algorithm with PySpark. The goal is to find significant association rules with  ùë†‚â•100  and high confidence scores.
We will list the top 5 association rules with highest confidence scores for itemsets of size 2 and 3.
